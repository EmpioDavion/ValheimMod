# ValheimModUtility
ValheimModUtility is a utility to simplify modding Valheim.
You can learn about modding Valheim in the <a href="https://github.com/EmpioDavion/ValheimMod/wiki">wiki</a>.

<h2>Installation:</h2>
Extract the zip to your steam/steamapps/common/Valheim folder.

<h2>Creating your own mods:</h2>
Make a copy of the ValheimExampleMod folder, and rename the copy to whatever you want your mod to be named.
Open up the copied project in Unity to start working on your mod.
The example mod is built in Unity 2019.4.12f1, so you should use that version to avoid any problems with project conversion.
